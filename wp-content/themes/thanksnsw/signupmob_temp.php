<a href="mailto: ?subject=100% pay at 18+ &body=Hey,%0D%0A%0D%0AI've just joined the 100% at 18+ campaign at http://www.100percentpay.com.au and I thought you would like to join me.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou might not have heard that people working in retail are only paid a percentage of the full adult rate at work - and they don't get full pay until they turn 21. It's called junior rates.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt means that when someone turns 18, they are only paid 70% of the full rate of pay. At 19, it's 80% and at 20 years old, it's 90%.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt just doesn't add up.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou can jump on the website http://www.100percentpay.com.au to sign up and show your support too and find out more about the campaign.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe more people we have supporting the campaign, the better chance we have of getting the full rate of pay for people from the age of 18.%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks!">LINK</a>
